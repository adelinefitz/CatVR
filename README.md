# Concepts

 - Tooltip
    Allow users to see a helpful tooltip when pointing with a certain gesture, much like hovering over something with a mouse, and will provide information about what an object is and/or how it can be interacted with

 - Grab (stationary objects)
    Allow users to move or interact with objects in the environment

 - Open/pour (held objects)
    When certain objects are held, new functionality becomes available

 - Go out (door, also menu)
    Combining the two senses of "leaving" (either leaving the main setting to go to a new location in game or leaving the game to quit) gives a more immersive feel to the game and prevents users from needing to remember a certain hand gesture to bring up the menu

 - Teleport
    Allow users to move about the room via a gesture
